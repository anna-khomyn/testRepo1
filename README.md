# testRepo1

This is my test repo just for learning and doing homework.

Here I can do a markdown list:
- one
- two
- three

Also, I can paste some quotes:
> Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
>  – Gandhi
>
>  It doesn’t matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
>  – Confucius


Check it out! A nice block of code ;)

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```
